## Native Apps QA - Code Challenge
The main objective of this assignment is measuring test engineering skills. 

## Requirements and Output

### Main Test Scenario:

1- Checkout code from https://github.com/shahidlatif2021/Splito and start implement following scenarios.

2- Verify that user cannot enter bill more than 10000.
3- Verify that in View Bill History Screen there is no record
4- Veirfy that in View Bill History Screen that total number of people is 0 by default
5- Verify that in View Bill History screen that total bill is 0 by default.




## Conditions:
- iOS Native App
- Code challenge to be done using Swift
- For automated tests, assertions are the key. We want you to explore the application and add the assertions that you think are important.
- Follow best practices for coding & automation (OOP, POM, reusable, clean, documented code).
- Start Appium server Programatically
- Test Report for the Automation (Optional)


## What we are looking for:
A code we can Trust!

This code is meant for testing, and passed execution does not mean working application; maybe testing code needs to be tested in the first place.

## Important points related to Delivery:
- Code challenge should be delivered as a link to a public git repository (github.com is preferred). 
- Implementations focusing on **quality over feature completeness** will be highly appreciated.  Donâ€™t feel compelled to implement everything, while compromising on code quality.
- Follow All the Best Practices for Implementing a Quality Automation Framework.
- Even if you are not able to complete the challenge, please do submit it anyways.
- Make sure you are able to run the tests successfully
- Please avoid any ToDo's in the code.
